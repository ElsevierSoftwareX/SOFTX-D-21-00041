Welcome to uguca! 

uguca is a spectral-boundary-integral (SBI) method to model the dynamic failure of an interface between two elastic half-spaces. The SBI method provides computational efficency and accuracy. For a detailed description of the theoretical basis for the SBI method, please refer to :doc:`./src/references`. 

In this online documentation, you find information on how to get and compile uguca, how to develop and run your own simulation, and how to develop additional features for uguca.
